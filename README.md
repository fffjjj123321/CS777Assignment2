Task4.1
Removing the stop words will reduce the text size, which means the computing time will be less than before. Also, KNN will be potentially changed because the "meaningless" words are reduced. KNN is obtained by observing units close to the target unit result. Therefore, the existence of stop words will be judged as a valid close unit. This will affect the accuracy of KNN.

Task4.2
I think stemming will have an effect on the results, but the effect is not huge because the results of stemming are words with similar meanings, and these words with similar meanings are much more useful than stop words. ["game", "gaming", "gamed", "games"] are just like these four words, we can pick any one of them at will to represent similar meanings in the subject of the article.
